The Yorker Website
==================

You're browsing the main codebase for the news website 'The Yorker'.
The purpose of this file is to give you an overview of how the site
and codebase are structured.

Stack
-----

Briefly, the site was built, and is intended to be run, on

Linux - Ruby 1.9 - Rails 3

TODO: database

Some bits of the stack will be more version-dependent than others; use
your imagination.

Structure
---------

This is a fairly standard rails application.


Key Models
----------

### User

Represents users (writers and commenters)

### Section

Represents sections, in a tree

### Article

Represents articles, which are in exactly one section


Secondary Models
----------------

### Editor

Represents users having 'Editor' priveleges wrt a section.

Do we want to extend this to some more general concept of a role?

### Author?

Should we model relationships between authors and articles?

### Visibility?

Should we model visibilty of articles
